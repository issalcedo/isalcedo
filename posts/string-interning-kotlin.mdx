## Production Outage
A seemingly simple feature was deployed and took down a highly critical component of the application. A simple rollback was issued, but the cause
was not obvious.

## Investigation
After it was confirmed that the rollback was successful, I started to investigate the changes included the release.
The feature was simple - it can be described as simple string comparisons between a source of truth and input from an
external source.

The change looked like something similar to the code below:
```kotlin:service.kt
fun isValid(input: String): Boolean {
  return Config.source === input
}
```

After reviewing the change, I checked to see if there were unit tests - which seemed unusual as we practiced TDD, but given
the circumstance, it warranted additional review. As expected, the unit tests exercised the function thoroughly.
I tried adding additional unit tests and walking the debugger, but could not find how this function can result in a
complete outage. After a break, I returned to continue with the investigation and noticed something odd (you may have spotted
the issue from the snippet of code). The comparison in the `isValid` function was using triple equal `===`. I had one of
those aha moments, when I knew noticed the subtle change.

## String Interning

What is String Interning? String interning is a compiler optimization most modern compilers have. It is the process
of creating a single copy of each distinct string value.

```kotlin:service.kt
val URL = "localhost"
Class Service {

  fun stringInterning() {
    val copy = "localhost"
  }

}
```

Using the example above, there are two declarations assigned to the string value. The compiler will optimize the declarations
by having both declarations point to the same instance of the string value `"localhost"` in memory.

The compiled source could look like the following:
```java:service.class
String _common = "localhost"
String URL = _common
Class Service {

  fun stringInterning() {
    String copy = _common
  }

}
```

## Further Investigation

```kotlin
@ExtendWith(MockKExtension::class)
class ServiceTest {
    lateinit var service: Service

    @MockK
    lateinit var configService: ConfigService

    @Test
    fun `it should return true when input value matches source value`() {
        val givenSource = Config(source = "valid")
        every {
            configService.get()
        } returns givenSource

        assertThat(service.isValid("valid")).isEqualTo(true)
    }
}
```
