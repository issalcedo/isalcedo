One of the challenges writing Node.JS microservices is being able to instrumentation like tracing to follow the path of a request within your service.
Due to the asynchronous nature of a Node.JS application, the platform doesn't supply a way to store context for each request and have it accessible
through the lifetime of the request. As a result, the developer is left to pass context objects down the request path. If the application follows
a traditional model of controller/service/store then managing the context becomes challenging.

The company I was working for in the past was building a micro-services platform for a video streaming application. Developers had the option develop microservices in two flavors: ``Java`` and `Node.JS`.
At the time, Java had a major advantage over Node.JS due to the progress Netflix had made in developing JVM microservices and sharing their solutions
to the world via open source. Our organization decided to support Node.JS because we believed it was more productive language and there was existing adoption. One of
my responsibilities was developing infrastructure tools for the Node.JS platform and bringing it up to parity with the JVM platform (e.g, circuit breakers, logging, service discovery and more).
When the concept of distributed tracing was introduced, I knew not having something like Java's `ThreadLocal` in Node.JS was going to make tasks like logging challenging.
The first iteration of the tools required developers to pass context where it was needed. As expected, the developer experience was undesirable.

## Improving the Experience

I've been following the development of ```async_hooks``` back when it was first introduced in version `8`. The `async_hooks` library allows you to attach listeners throughout the lifetime
of an asynchronous operation. There are libraries like [`cls-hooked`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cls-hooked) which levered `async_hooks` to work like thead-local storage in a threaded programming language.
Unfortunately, we were not able to utilize such libraries due to the overhead it added. However, Node.JS 13 and above has [improved performance](https://twitter.com/AndreyPechkurov/status/1234189388436967426?s=20).
It will be interesting to see how `async_hooks` is used in production now that the overhead concerns are starting to ease.

## How To Use `async_hooks`

The `async_hooks` library allows you to develop stores which remain accessible through the lifetime of the async operation. Node.JS recommends using `AsyncLocalStorage` because of the optimizations
built in. Lets explorer how to use `AsyncLocalStorage` to add trace info to logs.

I'm going to be using KOA for our HTTP Request Framework, Winston for logging, and Zipkin tracing.

Our application bootstrap and entrypoint:
```ts:index.ts
import Koa from 'koa'
const {Tracer, ConsoleRecorder, ExplicitContext} = require('zipkin');
const {koaMiddleware} = require('zipkin-instrumentation-koa');

const ctxImpl = new ExplicitContext();
const recorder = new ConsoleRecorder();
const tracer = new Tracer({recorder, ctxImpl, localServiceName: 'zipkin-koa-demo'});

import routes from './routes'

const app = new Koa()

app.use(koaMiddleware({tracer}));

routes(app)
```

Our application routes:
```ts:routes.ts
import Koa { Context } from 'koa'
import Router from 'koa-router'
import doSomething from './doSomething'

import logger from './logger'

const router = new Router({
  prefix: '/v1/resources'
})

router.get('/', async (ctx) => {
  logger.info('log something helpful from request')
  const response = doSomething()
  ctx.body = response
})

export default function (app: Koa) {
  app.use(router.routes())
}
```

Where we define our business logic:
```ts:doSomething.ts
import logger from './logger'

const helperFunction = () => {
  throw Error('unexpected error')
}

const doSomething = () => {
  try {
    return helperFunction()
  } catch(e) {
    logger.error('something went wrong', e)
    throw e
  }
}

export default doSomething
```

Our logging library:
```ts:logger.ts
import { createLogger, format, transports } from 'winston'

const logger = createLogger({
  format: format.combine(
    format.errors({ stack: true }),
    format.splat(),
    format.colorize(),
    format.timestamp(),
    format.printf(({ level, message, timestamp }) => {
      const object = {level, timestamp, message}
      return JSON.stringify(object) //simple json logger
    })
  ),
  transports: [new transports.Console()]
})

export default logger
```

We have a basic application which defines a simple route and `doSomething` module where we would define our business logic.
The `index.js` module adds `zipkin-instrumentation-koa` which is configured to output recordings to the console. There are two log messages: one at the entry point of the request and another in the catch block of our business logic layer.
The tracing library outputs request and response information. For example:

```shell
(timestamp=1629611119033842, spanId=427d92312b0bc9dc, parentId=427d92312b0bc9dc, traceId=427d92312b0bc9dc): ServiceName("zipkin-koa-demo")
(timestamp=1629611119046840, spanId=427d92312b0bc9dc, parentId=427d92312b0bc9dc, traceId=427d92312b0bc9dc): Rpc("GET")
(timestamp=1629611119047944, spanId=427d92312b0bc9dc, parentId=427d92312b0bc9dc, traceId=427d92312b0bc9dc): BinaryAnnotation(http.path="/v1/resources")
(timestamp=1629611120432434, spanId=427d92312b0bc9dc, parentId=427d92312b0bc9dc, traceId=427d92312b0bc9dc): BinaryAnnotation(http.status_code="200")
```

The trace information is useful for recording requests and responses. However, it doesn't tell the entire story of each request.
The log messages that are recorded after the HTTP layer provide insight of the health of the application, but in a large distributed system
with a high volume of requests, the log messages are difficult to correlate to the same request.

## Adding `AsyncLocalStorage`

Let's create middleware for Koa which will create an async local storage for incoming requests. The store will hold the trace information
supplied by zipkin, so we can access the trace IDs later down the in the service.

```ts:middleware.ts
import { AsyncLocalStorage } from 'async_hooks'
import { Context } from 'koa'

export interface ITraceId {
  spanId: string
  traceId: string
}

export const asyncLocalStorage = new AsyncLocalStorage<ITraceId>()

export const middleware = async (ctx: Context, next: () => Promise<void>) => {
  const { _spanId: spanId, _traceId: traceId } = ctx.request._trace_id
  await asyncLocalStorage.run({ spanId, traceId }, async () => {
    return await next()
  })
}

export default middleware
```

Our middleware imports `AsyncLocalStorage` and creates an instance. If you're using TypeScript like this example, you can
define the interface for the store. There are few things our middleware is doing: First it destructs the trace and span ID
from the property injected to the request object by the zipkin middleware. The next operation is executing the `run` function
which takes two arguments: the store values and a callback. The local storage works by having the async process execute within
the context of the callback. Within the context of the callback, the lifecycle of the process can be tracked. In this example,
it is simply invoking `next()` to execute the next middleware. Our middleware is also exporting the instance of `AsyncLocalStorage`
to be able to access our store from other modules. If you're invoking `await` inside the callback, make sure you `await` the `run()`
operation.

Now that we stored the trace information, we can access them in our logger.

```ts:logger.ts
import { createLogger, format, transports } from 'winston'
import { asyncLocalStorage } from '../middleware'

const logger = createLogger({
  format: format.combine(
    format.errors({ stack: true }),
    format.splat(),
    format.colorize(),
    format.timestamp(),
    format.printf(({ level, message, timestamp }) => {
      const object = {level, timestamp, message}
      const store = asyncLocalStorage.getStore()

      if (store) {
        object.traceId = store.traceId
        object.spanId = store.spanId
      }

      return JSON.stringify(object) //simple json logger
    })
  ),
  transports: [new transports.Console()]
})

export default logger
```

The logger imports the local storage. In `printf()`, we retrieve the store and add the trace properties to the object before it's stringified.
Before adding the properties, we check to make sure `store` exists. We have to check if `store` exists because the logger
may be invoked outside the context of the local storage.

The same can be applied to other tracing implementations or any infrastructure metadata that needs to be propagated without polluting method signatures.
I hope you find this helpful. I'd love to learn how you're using `AsyncLocalStorage`.
